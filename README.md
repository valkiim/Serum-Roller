# Serum-Roller
a c# implementation of Val's Serum effects. this is EXTREMELY nsfw, and a work in progress
at present, this application just pulls a text description of the effect to the fore, this app is intended to be used in addition to a user's storytelling. 

#Todo:
*Add a Roll History lookup- Added, it works, for now!
*Update effects to be "Smarter"
*Implement "lock" system, so people dont get things they hate
*add "passives" system, (feats!)
