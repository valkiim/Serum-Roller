Metaserums - 
Next orange/Blue, invert orange/Blue (both effects)
Blatant occurs again after next serum
Also include green blatant
Blatant effect occurs twice
Next orange is Purple (both effects)
next green is pink (both effects)
Also include Blue Blatant
Green compulsion- next serum conditional orange/blue blatant
override- Repeat blatant, no latent
Next two serums are double doses
roll Blue blatant, no latent, until orange or Pink
additional latent, and occurs again
orange Rebound, fixed effectiveness
Nullify everything but (pink && blue | orange | green)
roll 3x on next serum, chooses favorite. 

Timing triggers:
rightNow 	// because I cant spell immediate
thisAndNext	// right now and the next one
nextSerum	// queues an effect after the serum
nextOrange	// queues an effect after a specific serum
NextBlue
NextGreen
NextPink
NextTwo		// next serum, and the one after that
NextSize	// until the next orange or blue serum
untilOrangeOrPink	// until an orange or pink is drunk
Condition	// occurs when Text Threshold is met, Display next string a message, next 3 words = effect
	Else	// occurs if a condition is not met, ginored if met. nexxt 3 strings= effect
Effects
AddBlatant		// triggers a blatant of (colour)
AddLatent		// Triggers a blatant of (colour)
repeatBlatant		// make the blatant effect occur on timing (no colour needed)
replaceBothWith		// replace both effects with one generated by [colour]
GreenAddiction		// handles the weird case of green addiction (no coolour needed)
DoubleDose		// Serum effects will be processed twice (no colour needed)
NoLatent		// disables (random) latent on timing, no colour needed
onlyPinkOr		// blocks anything that is not pink or (colour), removed on pink or (colour)
add50Blat		// adds a blatant of Colour, 50% effective grow/shrink
invertSerum		// orange instead of blue, vice versa
chaosSerum		// green, Blue, and orange blatants all!
removeAspect		// remove an aspect, of th esubject's choosing or direction
ExtremeAdvantage	// that weird tripple advantage thing I put in PinkL12
greenWillpower		// allows for selection of Aspect OR location
Hybridize		// aspect foolery, why do so many green effects need special ones?!
